# Directory/folder Organizer
If your desktop or any directory is looking like this you came to the right place :D!

Basically this script asks for input for a directory or a folder in a directory example: Desktop or Desktop\FolderName. It will go through all your files and check the file type .pdf or .xlsx and then it will create a Folder inside the directory of input with the name "My_pdfs_files" or "My_xlsx_files" and then move all the files to the corresponding folder :)
